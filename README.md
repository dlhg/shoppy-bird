# Shoppy Bird

Shoppy Bird is a fun, engaging, Flappy Bird-inspired web game built with Phaser, React, TypeScript, and Vite. Test your reflexes by navigating Shoppy, the bird, through an endless series of pipes. Collect valuable items during regular gameplay and go on a collecting spree during the exciting Bonus Phase!

## Features

*   **Classic Flappy Bird Mechanics:** Simple tap/click controls to make Shoppy flap and fly.
*   **Dynamic Difficulty:** The game starts with wider pipe gaps for an easier introduction. As you progress, the gaps gradually narrow to the classic challenging width.
*   **Collectible Items:** Grab bronze, silver, gold, and diamond items between pipes for extra points.
*   **Bonus Phase:** After passing a certain number of pipes, a "Lucky Break" Bonus Phase triggers!
    *   Pipes temporarily disappear.
    *   Rainbow background and special music.
    *   Bonus items spawn rapidly for a limited time â€“ collect as many as you can!
    *   The number of pipes required to trigger the next Bonus Phase increases each time.
*   **Time-of-Day Cycle:** The background visuals dynamically change, cycling through sunrise, day, sunset, and night.
*   **Sound Effects & Music:** Immersive audio feedback for flapping, collecting items, scoring, collisions, and a distinct track for the Bonus Phase.
*   **High Score Tracking:** Your best score is saved locally in your browser.
*   **Pause Functionality:** Press 'P' to pause and resume the game.
